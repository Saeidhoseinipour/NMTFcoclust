# **NMTFcoclust**  
### **NMTFcocluster** (Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization for coclustering) is a library that implements decomposition on a data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ (document-word matrix and so on) with finding three  matrices $\mathbf{F}$ (roles membership rows), $\mathbf{G}$ (roles membership columns) and $\mathbf{S}$ (roles summary matrix) based optimazed $\alpha$-divergence.
